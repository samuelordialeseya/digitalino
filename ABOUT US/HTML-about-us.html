  <!--THANKYOU MESSAGE-->
  <div class="main-content">
      <p>
          We are students from Batangas State University - The National Engineering University Alangilan Campus. This website is made for a project in 
          Introduction to Computing (CC 100). But aside from this website being made out of a project, as first years who are Digitally Literate and Computer
          Science student, we loved the idea of sharing our knowledge when it comes to being Degitally Literate and aware. Having the ability to be <b>Digitally Literate</b> is an ability one acquires not by blessing or by being naturally gifted. 
          It is earned, learned, taught, and implemented to one's mind and consciousness. Always crave and run for more knowledge and skills 
          because we'll never catch up to what's in the present if we stopped running a long time ago. A lot of people who was a victim of
          cyber-crimes tend to think that their life is over. But it is not. Never let that stop you, but rather, take it as an opportunity to
          learn and recover from what has already happened. No words can express how thankful we are for having this chance to educate anyone who 
          stumbles upon our website as we also want to help those who need one. We'll never know who or when, but someday, we know someone will.
          And if it's you, we hope you have enjoyed your journey in learning and the creators would love to hear about your experience with the website!
      </p>
