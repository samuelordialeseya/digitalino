  <!--THANKYOU MESSAGE-->
  <div class="main-content">
    <p>
        Having the ability to be <b>Digitally Literate</b> is an ability one acquires not by blessing or by being naturally gifted. 
        It is earned, learned, taught, and implemented to one's mind and consciousness. Always crave and run for more knowledge and skills 
        because we'll never catch up to what's in the present if we stopped running a long time ago. A lot of people who was a victim of
        cyber-crimes tend to think that their life is over. But it is not. Never let that stop you, but rather, take it as an opportunity to
        learn and recover from what has already happened. No words can express how thankful we are for having this chance to educate anyone who 
        stumbles upon our website as we also want to help those who need one. We'll never know who or when, but someday, we know someone will.
        And if it's you, we hope you have enjoyed your journey in learning and the creators would love to hear about your experience with the website!
    </p>
