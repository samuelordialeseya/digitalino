      <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Choosing to meet a stranger who promises you a brand-new car, expensive gifts, or special treatment is one of the highest-risk decisions you could make online. This type of offer is a well-known manipulation tactic used by dangerous individuals to lure victims into unsafe situations. It is mostly used by <b>online predators, human traffickers, kidnappers, scammers, and so many more.</b></p>

  <!--FIRST BOX-->
  <div class="main-content">
      <h2><u>CONSEQUENCES OF MEETING STRANGERS WITH NO BACKGROUND CHECK</u></h2>
      <ul>
          <h4><li>You risk identity theft, because strangers can collect your personal information and use it to impersonate you, scam others, or access your accounts.</li></h4>
          <h4><li>You may fall victim to phishing scams, where the person tricks you into clicking harmful links or sharing passwords, OTPs, or banking details.</li></h4>
          <h4><li>You become vulnerable to online grooming, as predators can manipulate you emotionally and exploit your trust for harmful or illegal purposes.</li></h4>
          <h4><li>You can be targeted for cyberstalking, allowing the stranger to track your activities, harass you online, or even locate you offline.</li></h4>
          <h4><li>You may be exposed to human trafficking schemes, since many traffickers use online interactions to lure victims into unsafe real-life meetings.</li></h4>
          <h4><li>You risk being scammed or extorted, where the stranger may steal money, demand payments, or threaten to expose your private information.</li></h4>
          <h4><li>You increase the danger of physical harm, because online criminals often use digital communication as a setup for robbery, assault, or kidnapping in real life.</li></h4>

          But of course, there are ways to prevent the listed situations above. 
      </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="main-content2">
      <h2><u>PREVENTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS</u></h2>
      <ul>
          <h4><li>Always verify identities before engaging with anyone online, especially if they offer gifts, money, or meetups.</li></h4>
          <h4><li>Avoid sharing personal information, such as your address, school, phone number, or financial details with strangers.</li></h4>
          <h4><li>Use strong privacy settings on social media to limit who can view your posts and send you messages.</li></h4>
          <h4><li>Report suspicious accounts to platform authorities when someone behaves inappropriately or makes you uncomfortable.</li></h4>
          <h4><li>Talk to a trusted adult when you receive unusual messages, offers, or invitations from people you don’t know.</li></h4>
          <h4><li>Never meet someone from the internet alone, and only do so if your guardians approve and accompany you.</li></h4>
          <h4><li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your online accounts to protect against hacking attempts.</li></h4>
          <h4><li>Be cautious with links and files, as cybercriminals often use malware or phishing to steal your information.</li></h4>
          <h4><li>Educate yourself regularly about online safety, scams, and cybercrime trends to stay one step ahead.</li></h4>
